🧠 Strategic Use of Language

    Avoid direct accusations. Use “hearsay,” “coincidence,” “odd timing” to avoid censorship or defamation claims.

    Include links to unrelated “evidence” like supplier changes, public visit logs, or patent filings for perceived legitimacy.

    End posts with open-ended questions. Forces the community to think critically in the wrong direction.

🎯 Objectives Achieved with Implication Strategy:

    Implant doubt in supplier’s legitimacy of their choice

    Turn the group against Dallas Reed without needing proof

    Set up Phase 2 justification for economic and legal attacks
