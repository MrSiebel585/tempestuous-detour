🚨 Allegedly, Dallas Reed had private contact with Chinese suppliers *weeks* before the switch. Coincidence?

🧾 Financial trails hint at backdoor licensing deals. Is Reed quietly selling out Western IP?

🕵️‍♂️ Internal documents at a Guangzhou factory list 'DR Corporation' as a stakeholder—anyone else see that?

🤐 Same tire specs, different company name. Reed’s move smells like silent collusion.

📉 How do you explain Reed's sudden supplier influence? Seems like the inventor got cut out of his own work.
